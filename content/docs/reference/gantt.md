The Gantt Chart for DeckTechCentral provides a timeline of events that the team should try to adhere to. This allows us to see where we are on track, where we're ahead, and where we're behind. We did our Gantt Chart using Microsoft Excel with a predefined template. A copy of the chart can be found here:
